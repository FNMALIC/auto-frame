**Headline:** Recreating Auto-Framing Magic: From TikTok Inspiration to Python Reality 📸✨

I was scrolling through TikTok the other day when I stumbled across a video showcasing Samsung's auto-framing feature. You know the one – where the camera magically follows the speaker as they move around the room, keeping them perfectly centered.

My immediate thought wasn't "I need to buy that." It was **"I bet I can build that!"** 💡

So, I challenged myself to recreate it. A few hours of coding later, I had a working prototype using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.

I call it the **Smart Meeting Camera**. 🎥

It uses AI face detection to track my movements in real-time and creates a virtual webcam device that feeds directly into Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet. I even added smooth motion algorithms so it feels cinematic rather than robotic.

It’s amazing what you can build when you see something cool and decide to reverse-engineer it.
